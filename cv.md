## Briefly About Myself:

I received my Bachelor's degree in software engineering from Vitebsk State University of Technology in 2019, and in 2021 I received my Master's degree from the same university. At the university I studied programming languages such as Java and C++. I took internships and courses at EPAM Systems, and from 2019 to 2020 I worked as a salesforce full-stack developer at VRPConsulting. Then I studied JavaScript and React.

Now I work as a teacher at the IT department of Vitebsk State Technological College, combining it with freelancing.

I am actively studying such technologies as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React, so that in the future I can change my job from a teacher to a developer in an IT company.

## Skills:

-   HTML
-   CSS/SASS
-   JavaScript/TypeScript(Basic)
-   React(Basic)
-   Git

## English

B2 (Completed a paid B1 course and then got a B2 working for an IT company.)
